# Loading and Exploring Data
# First, we need to set the working directory, load the necessary libraries, and load the data.

# Set working directory to where the data files are located
# Change the path to the location where your data files are stored
setwd("C:/Users/ASUSPC/Google_Data_Analytics")

# Load necessary libraries
# tidyverse: a collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization
# lubridate: for working with date and time data
# janitor: for cleaning data
# ggplot2: for data visualization
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
# List all CSV files in the specified directory
data_files <- list.files(path = "C:/Users/ASUSPC/Google_Data_Analytics", pattern = "*.csv")

# Read and combine all CSV files into a single dataframe
bike_data <- data_files %>%
  map_df(~read_csv(.))

Column Descriptions

**ride_id**: Unique identifier for each ride.
**rideable_type**: Type of bike used (e.g., electric, classic).
**started_at**: Start date and time of the ride.
**ended_at**: End date and time of the ride.
**start_station_name**: Name of the start station.
**start_station_id**: ID of the start station.
**end_station_name**: Name of the end station.
**end_station_id**: ID of the end station.
**start_lat**: Latitude of the start location.
**start_lng**: Longitude of the start location.
**end_lat**: Latitude of the end location.
**end_lng**: Longitude of the end location.
**member_casual**: Type of user (member or casual).

# Selecting only the relevant columns from the bike_data dataframe

bike_data <- bike_data %>%
  select(
    ride_id,
    rideable_type,
    started_at,
    ended_at,

    end_station_name,
    member_casual
  )


# Display column names
names(bike_data)

# Check for NA values
colSums(is.na(bike_data)) 

```
As for the analysis we can see that "start_station_name" have 690,809 missing values, while  "end_station_name" have 739,170 missing values.
Since we cannot fill those values, the option left is to remove them.

The `min_ride_length` has a negative value. Since a negative ride length is not possible and likely indicates errors in date recording, we will remove these erroneous records from the dataset.
