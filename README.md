### Introduction

Welcome to my Cyclistic bike-share analysis project! In this case study, I step into the role of a junior data analyst for the fictional company Cyclistic. The goal of this project is to solve key business questions using real-world data. I'll be following the complete data analysis process—asking questions, preparing and analyzing data, and sharing insights to drive business decisions.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my analytical skills while exploring bike-share usage patterns and trends. 

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The company’s director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes increasing annual memberships is key to Cyclistic's growth. Your team is tasked with understanding how casual riders and annual members use the service differently to inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Before implementing any recommendations, the executive team needs to approve your insights, which must be supported by data-driven analysis and professional visualizations.

### About the Company

Cyclistic launched a bike-share program in 2016, now offering 5,824 bikes across 692 stations in Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked and returned at any station in the system. Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on general awareness with flexible pricing options: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Casual riders use single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members are more profitable. Cyclistic's finance team has emphasized the importance of growing the annual membership base for future success. Marketing director Lily Moreno aims to convert casual riders into members, believing they are already familiar with Cyclistic. To develop targeted strategies, the team will analyze historical bike trip data to understand rider behaviors and how digital media can support these efforts.
