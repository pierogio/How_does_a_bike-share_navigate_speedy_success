### Introduction

Welcome to my Cyclistic bike-share analysis project! In this case study, I step into the role of a junior data analyst for the fictional company Cyclistic. The goal of this project is to solve key business questions using real-world data. I'll be following the complete data analysis process—asking questions, preparing and analyzing data, and sharing insights to drive business decisions.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my analytical skills while exploring bike-share usage patterns and trends. 

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The company’s director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes increasing annual memberships is key to Cyclistic's growth. Your team is tasked with understanding how casual riders and annual members use the service differently to inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Before implementing any recommendations, the executive team needs to approve your insights, which must be supported by data-driven analysis and professional visualizations.
